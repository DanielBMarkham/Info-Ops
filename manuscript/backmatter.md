# Coming Soon

Enjoyed the book? Interested in taking this to the next level, working with large groups and vague value propositions? Check out "Info-Ops 2: The Sequel"[^bm-1]

[^bm-1]: I had initially planned to include this material in this book. Feedback from alpha and beta readers, however, have shown me that 1) there are two different audiences, 2) people will skip ahead and not know what the hell is going on, then blame the author for being confused, and 3) once you really understand what's in this book you're ready for the rest of it -- but not until then. So I split it up into two parts.

### Meta, Large Teams, and Teams of Teams

- Distributed tools
- Backlogs, Roadmapping, and Release Planning for multi-team efforts
- Working with Meta to standardize processes
- Complex dependencies and vendor-provided components
- Metrics at the enterprise level 
- Governance/Alignment
- Build/Buy, Portfolio Management

### Lean Startup

- Value propositions
- The true meaning of MVP
- Business Model Canvas 
- Startup planning: inflection points 
- The Valley of Death and Scaling
- Focus vs. Values
- The automation cycle
