# Preface To Info-Ops II And Invitation To Be A Beta Reader#

This book (The next book, Info-Ops II) is about thinking and programming. It's not about thinking. It's not a theory book full of fluff. It's not about programming. There are plenty of books that promise to "Learn You Some Java In 21 Days!". This is not one of them.

I've spent decades coding cool stuff. When I wasn't coding cool stuff I was teaching people how to code cool stuff. When I wasn't doing that, I was helping teams work together better and trying to figure out how startups and successful teams work.

Know what? There's a fuck-ton of great authors that know everything out there, and they're all writing books. They'll tell you how to think; how to cultivate the proper mindset for success. They'll tell you how to code; good code, clean code, smart code, code that makes you dance all night. These guys are a lot smarter than I am and they have a lot of great ideas. You should read them.

Ok then, why should you spend any time reading this book?

My job is thinking up goofy shit. I've spent a lifetime thinking up goofy shit. When people look at things one way, I look at them another. When I was a teenager, my mom used to ask, "If everyone jumped off a cliff, would you jump off one too?"

I would not. But if everyone was going to the bank to get free money, I would not go either. I'd probably jump off a cliff. Whichever way everybody was going, I'm going the other way. I have found that people, including myself, are broken, and the more of us you stick together, the more dumb we are. I'm interested in computers, logic, and analysis, not wondering what the cool kids are doing.

I wasn't even interested in programming. I was just good at it. And I didn't want to start teaching coders, teams, and all of that other crap. I was just good at it. I like people and want to help. Perhaps understanding how fucked up I was helped me understand how programmers and teams fucked up by approaching making solutions the wrong way.

So, completely without planning or desire, just out of a natural urge to take things apart to see how they work, I found myself *stuck* at the intersection of thinking and coding. One week I'd be reading books on philosophy, the next week software architecture, classical music and functional programming, history of human language and lean startups. Programmers would ask me questions like "How come some teams are awesome and some suck so badly when both teams start out with equally talented people?" I was not happy with any of the standard answers. I had to know *why*.

So I kept reading, kept listening and watching, and kept thinking up goofy shit, not really caring if any or it was popular or not. About one out of ten things I thought up? They actually sounded pretty good. Worth thinking about. People smarter than me told me that I might be on to something. I kept practicing until I got to maybe one out of five essays being interesting.

I do not know everything, don't know much of anything, actually, and reading this book will not make your private parts more attractive, make you rich in 30 days, teach you assembly-language programming, or make you Master Lord Of All Programming.

What it will do is save you a lot of time thinking up goofy shit on your own. It will save you a lot of time reading and researching various fields and the foundations of technology just to be a better coder. It'll teach you to avoid a lot of dead ends. It'll teach you *why*.

When you finish this, you won't be a better person. You won't be a better coder. You'll be a better person-who-codes. That is, you'll understand how humans and technology interact, each making the other one better (or worse). You'll be better at learning how to code, which languages to focus on, how to study, how to know you're studying the right thing. You'll be better at understanding what might work and what might not. You'll tune up how you think about computers so that you learn and do your job better. You're going to learn how to use computers to tune up how you think; identify and debug some coding errors you might be living with in your personal life by way of understanding how all humans and technology interact.

Let's face it: you're stuck with both your brain and the technology you love. By all means study and become a super giant at both of those, but also study and become a super giant at how the two interact at the intersection, the crisis point.

You'll finish this book knowing what's the next best tech to master. You'll finish this book having a better idea of how to evaluate your coding and other peoples'. You'll finish understanding the roots of many problems we all experience as programmers. Finally, you'll finish having a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence, what's wrong with it today, and how it can improve.

There's also some goofy shit, but I'll try to keep that to a minimum.

P.S. To read this book, you should know how to program. You should be able to write applications in at least a couple of different languages. You should be human. You should be familiar with scanning code in a language you've never seen before just to get gist of what's going on. Finally, if you have both OO and FP experience that's good. Double bonus points for people who have architected, written, and maintained large, complex apps. You're going to see a lot of familiar territory here.
