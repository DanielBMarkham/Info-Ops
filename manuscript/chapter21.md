# Chapter 21

## Grooming on-the-run


1. You are not allowed to have any important conversations unless it's to validate items already in the analysis (shared mental) model
2. You are not allowed to add things to the model unless it answers a relevant question or fixes a failing test at the current level 
3. You stop adding things to the model as soon as there is agreement that enough has been described to create a failing important test at some lower level

The ordering of tests by importance is called the backlog queue
