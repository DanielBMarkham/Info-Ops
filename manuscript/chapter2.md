# Chapter 2

"Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process."" - E.B. White[^2-1]

[^2-1]:White was author of Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little, among other books. He was also part of the team that made "The Elements of Style" or Strunk and White", one of the most influential books on the art of English writing in existence. This quote has also been attributed to Mark Twain.

If we're going to talk about information flow, we're going to have to talk about what people do with information when they get it. No, we've already established that this won't be a book on management theory, technology construction, startups, program management, artificial intelligence, backlogs, or product design, although it'll have a lot to do with all of those things and more. 

Instead, we have to ask the general question "What do people do with information that makes it useful to them? *Any* kind of people? *Any* kind of information?" If we can answer that question, we can talk about gathering, sorting, and optimizing information flow. If we can't, then we can all go out for beers. Our work here is done. 

But just like humor, this is something that we've done almost since birth, quite naturally. Funny things are funny because they're funny, and we gather and process information because that's what we do. To take it apart any further than that kills the frog -- takes the magic out.

Yet here we are. So here's the answer: *We ask questions to gain information in order to ask more questions*. 

All information participates as part of one or more question-response loops. That's its purpose. That's all its purpose. Nothing else.

## Socrates

![Socrates](images/socrates.png)

They killed Socrates[^2-2] for asking too many questions. There are a lot of things we can say about Socrates, but if you're looking for the shortest version, that's it.

[^2-2]:I'm writing all of the Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle stuff from memory after consuming a dozen or more different books over the years, using Wikipedia as a reminder of various dates and terms I might have forgotten along the way. If you're interested in the great thinkers of the western tradition that we talk about in this book, there's a great "The Great Courses" audio lecture series that's a great place to start. Google it.

There are three people in western history that form the basis for just about everything we do: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Socrates They're like a grandfather, father, and son. Socrates taught Plato. Plato taught Aristotle.

But it all started with questions.

Socrates lived about 2500 years ago, long before Jesus or even the Roman empire. He lived in the Greek city of Athens, and it was during a time that for the first time we had writing that would last forever and people of all kinds of religions and languages mixing it up in the Mediterranean.

Merchants made enough money to want to teach their kids to be more educated than they were. And along with writing and literature came the philosophers. The initial job of philosophers was something like "Smart people who we'll pay to train our kids to be smarter than we are."

That covered a lot of ground! But remember: there were no schools or colleges. No public libraries stocked full of books. If you wanted your kid smarter you had to send him *somewhere*, to *somebody*, and philosophers took over that job. If you were rich you hired a philosopher to come to your estate. But the really good philosophers had their own cool kids club where they taught a bunch of kids all at once.

Before Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle the Sophists were the great teachers of youth. This was a long, long time ago, and much of what we have is guesswork, but the Sophists were the first self-help authors. You know the ones. They're the folks telling you to "fake it until you make it", the people making those motivational posters, the guys writing books promising a new you.

The Sophists taught rhetoric, the art of speaking well and arguing. They also taught how to be well-regarded, how to get along with others, how to move up in the world. These were all skills that any merchant would want their kids to have.

The problem was, while it made the kids much easier to be around, it didn't make the kids any smarter. It's like the guy who took so much training he's the best salesman and manager in the world, but the product sucks. People love to be around him, he's invited to all the parties -- but there's a huge thing missing. There's no depth. There's great packaging, just nothing inside the box.

After a long time paying for those teachers, people wondered: What was missing? What's wrong here?

Questions.

"When I left him, I reasoned thus with myself: I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know." - Socrates[~2-3]

[^2-3]: From Plato's Apology, the account of the trial of Socrates.

Socrates didn't charge for his school. He didn't teach kids to look good. Instead he taught something else, one of the most valuable things to have in life, something that we could probably summarize by calling it *intellectual humility*. He knew that he didn't know.

Socrates was professionally curious. He specialized in asking good questions. They even have a method used today named after him: The Socratic Method. The Socratic Method is a way for 2 or more people to bounce ideas back and forth by asking each other honest and penetrating questions based on the conversation so far. 

In the Socratic Method people challenge one another's ideas -- as sharply as they can -- but not the people themselves. It's a friendly yet sharp exchange of questions seeking a common understanding of some subject. One philosopher called it "midwifery", because just as a midwife helps a woman give birth, the Socratic Method helps a group of people come to a better understanding of something.[^2-4]

[^2-4]:I had a boss once that used to ask me questions until I finally came to the conclusion that I had to do whatever it was that he wanted me to do. I guess he felt this was better than just telling me what to do. After one half-hour session of my playing "guess the right question", I wanted to punch him in the nose. I believe that he thought he was using the Socratic Method. He was not.

Socrates would hang out at the city gates, watching all the rich and powerful people walk by. Being taught by the Sophists, they would say something that people loved and sounded awesome.

So Socrates would ask them a question, In the spirit of honesty and humility, he would ask them a question that involved explaining why they said what they said.

As you can imagine, it didn't take much questioning at all before these people looked like idiots to everybody else. This was a very bad thing! After all, image was everything to these folks. (Just not Socrates.) Whether he meant to or not, Socrates had a way of taking apart things. Many times once you passed the surface detail, there was nothing else there.

Socrates wasn't the most popular guy around town. The kids loved him. The rich and powerful folks despised him.

So they killed him. After a trial, they made him drink a poison, which he did voluntarily.

We lost any direct information about Socrates. All we know is from his student Plato.

Plato picked up where Socrates left off, writing down as much as he could of what Socrates wrote and forming a school where the way Socrates thought could be learned by anybody that wanted to attend.

It's impossible to overstate what a huge impact all these old Greek dudes had 2500 years ago. All of western thought, all of western science, every piece of tech you hold in your hand, every sci-fi movie you've ever seen -- most everything we interact with has been called "footnotes to Plato"[^2-5]

[^2-5]: The full quote is "The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato." by Alfred North Whitehead in "Process and Reality". Free Press, 1979

Plato had a student, Aristotle. Aristotle has been called "Father of Logic", "Father of Natural Science", "Father of Biology", "Father of Political Science" One of Aristotle's students was Alexander the Great, who went on to conquer much of the known world.

What the heck is up with these guys? How can they be considered to have had such a huge impact on, well, basically everybody?

Questions.

When you were a tiny baby, you interacted with your environment. Maybe you moved your hand one way and a light came on. So you thought that your hand controlled the light. Your mother? Just an extension of yourself. When you cry another part of yourself, your mom, comes. Things change. 

You have the ability to recognize stimulus and response, you just don't have any kind of mental model for how it all works. You know that when you cry, things happen and eventually you stop crying, but you have no concept of pooping, hunger, other people...anything. It's all just stimulus and response.

Once you start talking, after saying "No" approximately fourteen-thousand times, you start with that question. The question adults far and wide fear coming from the mouth of a two-year-old.

"Why?"

As anybody who has been around small children know, you can spend an hour with a child simply answering the question "why."

Why is the sky blue? Because of Rayleigh Scattering. What's a Rayleigh? He was a famous scientist. Why? Because people liked him. Why? Because he said smart things. Why?

And so on. Most times this ends with the adult saying "Because I said so!" and both conversation participants leaving unfulfilled.

After about twenty minutes of this game with my nephew Jonathan one day, I finally said, "Jonathan, I love you with all of my heart. Why do you keep asking 'why'?"

"Because I want to know stuff"

I had nothing on that. He was absolutely correct.

We ask questions to form *mental models* of our environment. That is, we already know about stimulus and response. What we want to know is the words and symbols associated with that: what they are, how they fit together, how to put them together in new ways. We want a model of abstract things in our heads we can use. So we ask questions.

This has been going on since people could talk, however. What made those old Greek guys so special?

What Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle figured out was that there was a process where groups of people came together and asked questions that created a *shared mental model*, that is, you could take 10 or 20 people, put them in a close group, and they could ask each other questions about *anything*. After a while, you could take each of them aside and they would all have similar answers to the types of questions discussed. 

This is one of those things which sounds completely facile. Why of course they would have the same answers! What else would we expect?

Well, if they argued, instead of asking honest, humble, and probing questions, they would continue to have different models. If they met in smaller groups, each group would have the same model but the overall group would be split. In fact, different sub-groups would coalesce more or less depending on how good their questions were of each other.

This was a process that held true no matter what the topic. You could pick anything you could express in words, put a group of people together, and they would form a common mental model around those things. 

People had been doing this for thousands of years before the Greeks, of course, but it was Socrates and his buds that figured out that this was a generic process you could apply to anything.

You paid good money for this book, so let's toss in some fancy words you can use to impress your friends. The Greeks taught the **dialectic**[^2-6]. The dialectic is when somebody proposes something to be true, called a "thesis". Another person proposes something different to be true, a "antithesis". Then the battle engages. Other theses are suggested. Other aintitheses are presented to oppose these theses. Over time, all of the people that are part of the dialectic decide that either a thesis is true, an antithesis is true, or more likely -- there is a synthesis between the thesis and antithesis that is true. In other words, both are kinda true and both are kinda false, depending on how you look at things.

[^2-6]: Plato tells us it was Zeno of Elea that invented the dialectic. As you can imagine, in order to make this book work I have chosen to eliminate and skip huge, important parts of history. Zeno is also the one who came up with several paradoxes that you'll still see people talking about today.

The Greeks, starting a tradition that has lived proudly with every philosopher since them, took this discovery too far. In their minds, the dialectic was what people used to determine truth. After all, if you had a bunch of the smartest people in the world in a room, and they all engaged as passionately and intelligently as they could with a topic through thesis and antithesis, what else could you come up with beside truth?

(Later on, of course, smarter people came along and took the same subjects, went through the same process, and came up with different answers. They also thought they knew the truth, but then still *smarter* people came along, and so on.)

The dialectic is the basis of everything. Everything that science is that we know? It's the result of the dialectic coming down through the ages on various topics. Your cell phone works because of electronics. Electronics work because of electricity and atomic theory. Electricity and atomic theory work because of probability and the calculus. You trace anything in your life far enough back, and you've got this wonderful conversation happening between really smart people that results in a *shared mental model* of how the world works.

That doesn't make it right or wrong, true or false. It just makes it tremendously useful.[^2-7]

[^2-7]: This was your epistemology lesson for today. Nothing means anything. Epistemology is an important subject, but it's not for the faint-hearted. We know a lot of stuff, but the word "know" isn't as rock-solid as you probably think it is. Much of our life growing up is learning one thing to be true, only to find out it was all a simplified fairy tale made into something you could understand at the time. Then you learn the "next level", only to find out later that they fooled you again. At the top of each field, if you're honest with yourself you realize you don't know much of anything at all. And, like Socrates, you've finally found wisdom.

Aside from being a lovable old coot, why am I telling long-winded stories about old Greek guys in togas? Because the dialectic is the tool we still use today to do anything in life: develop products, teach students, send people to the moon. All of that is the result of the dialectic.

* **All information exists either as the result or the input to a dialectic** *

So that's our end-state. When we talk about optimizing information flow, we mean that we want to use the minimum amount of effort to get the maximum result in supporting the dialectics that accomplish our mission. 

Let's say this a little differently: *We want to make sure people have as much and only as much information needed to ask the best questions possible to get their job done.* No extra information. No digging around for information that's hard to get. No missing information. No waiting around. No misleading information. Just enough and exactly at the right time for productive dialectic to occur. And when dialectics occur, the results of those dialectics should go back into the system.

On Air France 447, the key question was this: which was is the plane pointed? The pilots in that cockpit did not have the information they needed to know that they should have been asking that question. Sadder still, the people who designed, built, and trained the pilots did not have a shared mental model with the pilots in the cockpit that night enough to understand that what they thought they understood was not what the plane was telling them.

Many times we build things right -- they have quality, they conform to specs, they're easy-to-use and own. We just don't build the right things. The information flow is inadequate. Our models are different. Critical dialectics never happen.

Information doesn't get to the right people at the right time. People die.
