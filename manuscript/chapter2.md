# Chapter 2

“Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process.” - E.B. White[^2-1]

[^2-1]:White was author of Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little, among other books. He was also part of the team that made "The Elements of Style" or Strunk and White", one of the most influential books on the art of English writing in existence. This quote has also been attributed to Mark Twain.

If we're going to talk about information flow, we're going to have to talk about what people do with information when they get it. No, we've already established that this won't be a book on management theory, technology construction, startups, program management, artificial intelligence, backlogs, or product design, although it'll have a lot to do with all of those things and more. 

Instead, we have to ask the general question "What do people do with information that makes it useful to them? *Any* kind of people? *Any* kind of information?" If we can answer that question, we can talk about gathering, sorting, and optimizing information flow. If we can't, then we can all go out for beers. Our work here is done. 

But just like humor, this is something that we've done almost since birth, quite naturally. Funny things are funny because they're funny, and we gather and process information because that's what we do. To take it apart any further than that kills the frog -- takes the magic out.

Yet here we are. So here's the answer: *We ask questions to gain information in order to ask more questions* All information participates as part of one or more question-response loops. That's its purpose. That's all its purpose. Nothing else.

**Whoa, said the turkey!** I'm not sure we have another time machine.
