# Chapter 20

Congratulations! You've just received a large grant from a well-known charity to write software to support oppossum flying schools. Flying squirrels get all the good press, and the group "Opossums United Curicculum Help (OUCH!)" wants a computer program to help those brave folk around the world who are teaching opossums to fly. They are too often forgotten. Have you ever seen a fundraiser for oppossum trainers? See?

Along with the grant came a first-class ticket to Hooterville, Illinois, home of the World Famous Flying Possum Pilots, a school for possums wanting to break free of the usual midnight snack around the cat bowl.

As you walk through the gates and onto hallowed ground, a plaque welcomes you.

1. You are not allowed to have any important conversations unless it's to validate items already in the analysis (shared mental) model
2. You are not allowed to add things to the model unless it answers a relevant question or fixes a failing test at the current level 
3. You stop adding things to the model as soon as there is agreement that enough has been described to create a failing important test at some lower level

The ordering of tests by importance is called the backlog queue
