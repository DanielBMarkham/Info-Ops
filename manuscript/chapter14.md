### General Instructions

Once there, you'll see a green button that says "Clone or Download". Click on that. If you're a programmer and know how to use git, you'll probably clone the repository. Otherwise you'll click on the "Download zip" button to get a zip file of the project.

Once the zip file has been downloaded, extract it into a folder that you can remember.
