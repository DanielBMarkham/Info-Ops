But Marc Dubois wasn't thinking that as he walked out on the Rio de Janeiro airport tarmac on May 31, 2009. It was a beautiful evening, light winds and unlimited visibility. Dubois looked up at the Airbus 330 that he was going to fly from Rio to Paris. There was nothing to be worried about. Just the usual convection storms around the equator.

The flight was mostly full. There was a relatively new junior co-pilot on board, but even he had hundreds of hours in the plane and in the region. There was nothing to suggest anything was amiss. We don't know for sure, but in all likelihood, Dubois's mind was dwelling on his beautiful Brazillian mistress and the evening they had spent together the night before. He had only gotten about an hour of sleep. 

Yawning, he watched a few light clouds blow in from the sea. As the sun slowly sank in the tropical sky, the plane loaded up and excitement was in the air. Soon they would be in Paris.

They would all be dead within four hours.

As the huge, 150+ ton airplane went nosewheel-up and began climbing into the sky, Dubois was at the controls. As senior pilot, he always took the controls on the first part of the flight. But the flight was too long for any one person to fly, so around 3.5 hours into the flight, he turned the controls over to the new guy, the junior copilot.

He reminds them that they're entering the normal thunderstorm area and to be careful.

They will all be dead within 15 minutes. Experts agree that had the pilot gotten more sleep the night before, had he stayed in the cockpit just a little longer, nothing would have ever happened.

But that's not what happened. Instead, the two junior pilots at the controls now call the flight attendents in the back and let them know there will be some turbulence ahead.
