Information doesn't get to the right people at the right time. 

People die.

But that was the farthest thing from Marc Dubois mind as he walked out on the Rio de Janeiro tarmac on May 31, 2009. It was a beautiful evening, light winds and unlimited visibility. Dubois was taking an Airbus 330 from Rio to Paris, and there was nothing to be worried about. Just the usual storms around the equator this time of year.

They had a mostly-full flight, and a relatively new junior co-pilot on board, but there was nothing to suggest anything at all was up. In all likelihood, Dubois's mind was on his beautiful Brazillian mistress and the evening they had spent the night before. He had only gotten about an hour of sleep. As the sun sank in the tropical sky, the plane was loading up and excitement was in the air.

They would all be dead within four hours.
