## Managing Intangibles

We've spent a lot of time in this section talking about using Structured Analysis to create technology solutions: programs, websites, robots, space stations, mars colonies, decks, things like that. Things that you can touch or see. Things where you create your own reality as you go. Things that require creative work to make happen.

The book started with an introduction to questions, the dialectic, analysis, and Structured Analysis. No matter what information you have, it's going to fit somewhere in an Analysis model, even if it's only in your head. Then we moved to working by yourself, using Structured Analysis to have better conversations with people you're trying to help. Finally we moved out to teams, talking about how teams operate to gather and move information around as they create things people want.

So what are the limits? Is every effort something where Structured Analysis can give you the minimum amount of work for the maximum amount of value?

It is not. Structured Analysis is the way we understand and make sense of things, whether we realize it or not. But not everything is understandable. Many times we try to understand whatever we're doing as if it were a computer program because that's an easier world to understand.

To help sort it all out, here are the questions I go through when somebody asks an odd question like "Can I use this to write my dance for elephants?"

### What is the Target System?

While analysis is always in the same three buckets and abstraction levels, work is in the form of To-Be System Reazlied Behavior and Supplementals. All work is to change some target system so that it exhibits new behavior and follows new rules.

What is the target system? It seems like kind of a trivial question, don't people realize what they're working on?

They do not, many times because they would rather define work in terms that's easy for them to understand.

Let's say you are on a team that manages a dozen other teams creating a fleet of self-piloting underwater slot machines. These things happen. As a team that manages other teams, what is your target system?

If said "the other teams", you are wrong. Your target system is creating that fleet of underwater gambling robots. The teams are simply one of the tools you're using to do that. You have a lot of other tools to use: webinars, seminars, conferences, press appearances, COTS evaluation, and so on. The minute you take your focus off the target system is the minute you've stopped being part of the solution and started being part of the problem.

So you still have work items, Behaviors joined up with Suppelmentals to make goals/tests. It's just that you have many more tools to master and use appropriately than one guy working out of a closet.

There's a discussion to be had around the Meta genre and managing/leading people, but that's not your target system.

Let's say you're managing a political campaign. You've built enough doghouses in your career that you're finally going to run for dog-catchter.

What's your target system?

If you're like a lot of people, you might start off asking questions and mentally-modeling political campaigns. Let's see, there are are various forms of media, there are different ways to interact....

Pretty soon you could have an entire model built around "running a campaign". It would show the world of politcal campaigns.

It would be wrong.

Looking at the Analysis Survey, the top row is all about how our model touches the outside world. It's no coincidence that the first thing you see are Actors. Determining your target system begins with asking "Who are the people I am trying to help?"

What you've done is assume that you are the actor. You are modeling and creating a system for you to use. But that's not what you're doing at all. Yes, you'll have to use/create/invent some kind of system, but what you're doing is changing the behavior of voters. Voters and people who might vote are the actors. They're the people who want stuff that you're striving to help. What do they want? How can you help them? Beats me. That's the work.

If you think you're the actor of the target system, you end up creating stuff that you think you *should* want, if you knew what you were doing. It's kind of a dysfunctional game of play-pretend. You think "If I were some super succesful political guy, I would need all kinds of cool tools to run my campaign"

There are times where you are the Actor. The system is about you: finding out what you do, finding out how you'd like things done, and so on. But in the political campaign scenario, if you're happy but you're not elected? You're not happy. So you can't be the actor. Instead, just like before, you and the things you do are tools.

This is an interesting example because not only are you trying to provide benefits to the average voter, your ultimate goal isn't to help them do thing they already do but start doing things they currently don't. This is a special type of work where you're both observing and trying to change actor behaviors. That comes under Lean Startup at the end of the book.

### Is the Target System a Formal System?

There's a lot of really nerdy stuff here out of my league. The important point is that computers and technology follow certain rules. Math follows certain rules. When we construct a solution using math and technology, we're assuming the world we model also conforms to the rules of math and technology.

You cannot engage in a productive dialectic with a crazy person because they're under no obligation to have a logical and consistent view of the universe. 

In general, whatever the target system, it should have at least these properties:

- Consists of primitives that are put together in various ways according to a set of rules
- Recursively decidable. You should be able to determine whether or not something is true or false given the rest of the system. This might involve drilling down through other parts of the system. You couldn't model the art of singing because singing has attributes that are undecidable. As much as I might try, I can't take math and become a better karaoke singer.
- Isomorphic to a formal language. With technology, this is fairly easy, since technology runs on various computer languages, which are a type of formal language.
- Logical. It is consistent. If something is one way in one place, it's the same way in another
- Deductive. Given that certain things are true, it follows (you can deduce) that other things must be true also.

A deck follows these rules. So does a Mars Colony project. A computer program certainly does. A children's book about donkeys from the edge of space probably does not. (Depending on the donkeys)

You can certainly use Analysis, Structured or otherwise, to try to make sense of such systems. After all, there's nothing else available to you. But trying to gain traction to change the future behavior of the target system when the target system is not a formal one is mostly an exercise in frustration. You can't write accounting software with jello.

### What kind of World does the Target System exist in?

![Cynefin Framework](images/cynefin.jpg)

Every system that you build or modify must interact with the outside world. For those of you new to the world, various pieces of the world operate in different ways.

In 1999 Dave Snowden began work on a model to help manage intellectual capital at IBM. That's what Wikipedia says. What that means is that IBM had a lot of really smart people who knew a lot of smart stuff. Could IBM take an inventory of all the smart people and smart stuff they knew? Put it into some kind database or library? That way if you wanted to find somebody who was able to speak French and could juggle cats, you'd just enter stuff on a screen somewhere.

Dave dove into this and ended up with a question. (Everything good in life begins with a question). How do you sort out the types of things people know and can do? You'd think that you might organize kind of like a libraray, maybe alphabetically. But actually didn't help when folks went to look up stuff. 

Instead, Snowden took a look at Epistemology, squinted his eyes a bit and condensed a hundreds of years of smart people thinking about stuff into a list of four kinds of environments you might find yourself in. Once you knew what kind of environment you're in, then you could start looking up folks who knew or were able to do stuff.

Here are the four "Domains"

- Simple/Obvious/Clear. This is when you are in a "known knowns" situation. There are rules. The relationship between cause and effect is clear. Do X, Y happens. Every time. Anybody can move around and make sense in this domain.
- Complicated. This is when you are in a "known unknowns" situation. Given X, you can make Y happen, but it takes intellectual work and expertise. Building software is an example of a complex domain.
- Complex. This is the "unknown unknowns" situation. Things happen for a logical reason, but you're never exactly sure what that reason is. Much of like occurs in the Complex Domain, although our brains keep cheating and pretending that we're actually in one of easier ones. Usually we deal with this domain by watching, doing stuff, then looking backwards to try to find patterns. Patterns may only be guesses, but they're the best we've got. If we get a pattern of doing stuff and having other stuff happen, it's progress.
- Chaotic. Intractable. Things happen. We do things. Other things happen. Cause and effect are unclear and maybe non-existent given our current knowledge. Chaotic environments are environments you can't make sense of. You end up relying on intuition, imagination, and luck. When you're in a Chaotic environment, your main goal is to try to do something, anything, to reduce it to a Complex one. Complicated or Simple would be even better.

If you're writing a program to balance checking accounts, the larger domain that the target system is operating in is math and accounting. It's a Simple Domain. You add, you subtract. It can be no simpler.

If you're writing a program to assess the accounting practices of a multinational corporation, you're helping your Actors operate in the Complicated Domain. There are a lot of simple parts, but it requires expertise to figure out and master. Your job as programmer is to create a target system where the Actors can work in a Complicated Domain. 

If you're writing a program to manage stock portfolios, you're helping your Actors operate in a Complex Domain. 

You can't write any software for chaotic systems. People are receiving information they can't process or understand. There's certainly nothing you could do to help folks in a place like this. "Use the Force, Luke" is as good advice as any.

Even if the Target System you're creating or changing is a formal system, if it exists in a chaotic environment, or if it's built assuming the environment is one way when it's another, it's not going to be useful.

### How do we Observe The System? What are the executable tests?

It's funny how so many of these points sound trivial but are actually deep and important. If you can't observe the target system, you can't do any useful work.
