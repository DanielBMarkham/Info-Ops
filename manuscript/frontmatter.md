# Preface: What to Expect in this Book

![We take apart natural conversations to show you what's going on inside](images/conversations.png)

This book is about organizing all the information that's generated when you're creating something that's not actually building the product: user notes, questions, diagrams, workshops, website data, backlogs, CRC cards, user stories, character maps, wireframes, and so on.

This book is useful anytime you have 2 or more people attempting to create something that's never been done before, whether it's a spaceship, fantasy world, web application, startup, or undersea farming community.

This book is not about process, although various processes are used as examples. A hundred years from now everybody may using WhizBangOMatic Process 7.0. The principles in this book will still apply and be useful. You will, however, find a lot of insight into whatever processes you are currently using and how to make them better.

This book is not about theory and hand-waving, although we have to cover theory first. The first part of the book is solely about understanding theory and the basics. Once we've finished that, in later sections we'll learn to apply the theory in small teams, teams-of-teams (programs/PMOs), and startups.

This book will have programming. The nature of most all project work is that you collect far more information than you hang on to in your head, so it has to go somewhere. To be practical you have to learn how to store and suffle potentially large amounts of information around. After Section 1, for everything we learn and do, we'll also talk about how to automate it.
