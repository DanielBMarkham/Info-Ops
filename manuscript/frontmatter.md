# Preface: What to Expect in this Book

![Have more creative and productive conversations by understanding how they work](images/conversations.png)

This book is about making things people want.

Specifically, this book is about organizing all the information that's generated when you're not directly, physically engaged with creating something. Conversations that happen when you're not actually building the product: user notes, questions, diagrams, workshops, website data, backlogs, CRC cards, user stories, character maps, wireframes, and so on.

This book is useful anytime you have two or more people attempting to create something that's never been done before, whether it's a spaceship, fantasy world, TV game show, web application, startup, or undersea farming community.

This book is not about process, although various processes are used as examples. A hundred years from now everybody may using WhizBangOMatic Process 7.0. The principles in this book will still apply and be useful. It is about how various processes work, and why. When you finish you should be able to improve whatever your existing processes are and look at proposed new processes with a critical eye.

This book is not about theory and fuzzy concepts, it is solely dedicated to making things people want. But you have to understand theory before you can learn anything useful, and new concepts always sound fuzzy until you realize how they're put to use. The first part of the book is solely about understanding theory and the basics along with examples. Once we've finished that, later we'll learn to apply the theory in small teams, teams-of-teams (programs/PMOs), and startups.

This book has programming in it. The nature of most all project work is that you collect far more information than you hang on to in your head. It has to go somewhere. To be practical you have to learn how to store and shuffle potentially large amounts of information around. After Section 1, for everything we learn and do, we'll also talk about how to automate it.

Finally, this book has a lot of silly examples. This is by design. Because I'm teaching you how to think, there's a great danger that if I provide an example that looks something like what you're currently doing, you'll just "lift and shift" and take whatever the example is and plug it into your project. 

It doesn't work like that.

In order to prevent this from happening, and in order to stop you thinking about immediate application and get you thinking about the skills you need to develop, I've done my best to come up with various ludicrous scenarios. Once you learn the skills, there are limitless ways you can apply what you've learned here. But you have to do the work first. In the field of analysis, without the knowledge and skills, no amount of "how-to" instructions is going to amount to anything. In fact it's more likely to hurt you than help. My career has been full of people doing a lot of really bad analysis because they just wanted simple instructions and quick fix. Don't be that person.

Finally, if you've already been exposed to some of the concepts here, you may find problems with the way I am presenting things. Why didn't he include X? How can he talk about B without mentioning A first?

I've found with most all of these concerns, within five or ten pages it works itself out and makes sense. There are a few major topics I purposely skip and hold off addressing until later. All of these are marked with footnotes.

Do the work. It's just a bit of reading, perhaps over a weekend, and after you're done you can immediately do all sorts of things you may have never thought possible before. I promise you'll be happy with what you learn.
