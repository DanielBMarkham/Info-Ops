# Preface: What to Expect in this Book

![Have more creative and productive conversations by understanding how they work](images/conversations.png)

This book is about making things people want.

Specifically, this book is about organizing all the information that's generated when you're not directly, physically engaged with creating something. Conversations that happen when you're not actually building the product: user notes, questions, diagrams, workshops, website data, backlogs, CRC cards, user stories, character maps, wireframes, and so on.

This book is useful anytime you have 2 or more people attempting to create something that's never been done before, whether it's a spaceship, fantasy world, TV game show, web application, startup, or undersea farming community.

This book is not about process, although various processes are used as examples. A hundred years from now everybody may using WhizBangOMatic Process 7.0. The principles in this book will still apply and be useful. It is about how various processes work, and why. When you finish you should be able to improve whatever your existing processes are and look at proposed new processes with a critical eye.

This book is not about theory and fuzzy concepts, it is solely dedicated to making things people want. But you have to understand theory before you can learn anything useful, and new concepts sound fuzzy until you realize how they're put to use. The first part of the book is solely about understanding theory and the basics along with examples. Once we've finished that, in later sections we'll learn to apply the theory in small teams, teams-of-teams (programs/PMOs), and startups.

This book has programming in it. The nature of most all project work is that you collect far more information than you hang on to in your head, so it has to go somewhere. To be practical you have to learn how to store and shuffle potentially large amounts of information around. After Section 1, for everything we learn and do, we'll also talk about how to automate it.
