# Chapter 19

Just to get everybody caught up in case some of you were sleeping, a backlog is a series of partially-constructed tests describing Behavior To-Be by combining Behavior To-Be and various Supplementals To-Be. Tasks are to-do items. 

Tasks do not go in the backlog. A list of tasks is just a to-do list. Tasks are fine and necessary, they're just not part of Structured Analysis. Set aside time for to-do items everyday. Put post-its on your monitor. There are tons of ways to keep track of your tasks. The backlog isn't one of them. In general, breaking down creative work into tasks tends to make the results less creative and add waste to the system -- sometimes extremely so. (The same can not be said of breaking down big tasks into smaller tasks in a non-creative, factory-like environment where value discovery is completely off-the-table.)

## How NOT to do Backlog Grooming

Require a large group to attend. Only have it once a month or so, and make sure the group that is attending never see each other much during the day. (This will provide for an incredible amount of cross-talk and make it difficult to stay focused) Use a projector in a darkened room, especially after lunch, because who doesn't like projectors in a dark room after a big meal?

Once everybody is assembled, bring up a big list of items on an electronic tool, preferably all prefixed with some impenetrable code. "First up is CS743183. Who can forget that one?"

Ask a bunch of questions that are related to whatever process you are doing instead of the nature of the work. "How many points for 'Reverse polarity on the deflector array?'", and "Has the TPS cover sheet been completed for this?"

Never talk about the overall scope of work, only tiny items in a large list. 

Hold it a day or two before sprint close, so that it people will be sitting there worrying about completing the rest of their work.

Do this enough times and you could be brought up on war crimes. Or get promoted. Either is equally likely.

## Backlog grooming

Grooming does four things:

1. Introduces new information to the team to consider
2. Synchronizes the Analysis Model
3. Cleans up the backlog to make it manageable
4. Verifies that we're ready to create tests for the next piece of work 

The actual creation and execution of the tests happens somewhere else.

Grooming is what we did in the deck example every time we went back home and got organized for another conversation. It doesn't create information, it just organizes it.
