## Info-Ops Wrap-Up

Look at you. You've finished up the Info-Ops book and are now ready to go make the world a better place. I can't wait to see what you accomplish.

Together, we have truly accomplished feats of a brobnagagian nature. (Brobnagagian means "big". It's your last complicated-sounding word. Thank me later.) There's a huge distance between average folks struggling through projects and people who know and use these skills effectively. Now you're a member of an elite group.

I'm not trying to BS you. This is knowledge and skills that no formal course I know teaches -- yet they are critical for the happiness and productivity of any team creating anything of value. I wrote this because nobody else had written it. It needed to be done.

We started our journey together talking about Air France 447. In that story, everybody involved, managers, engineers, assemblers, maintenance operators, and finally pilots were highly-trained professionals. They were acting using industry best practices. In any other circumstances, things would have been fine. The A330 had been flying over 25 years when the crash occurred. It had safely taken millions of people where they wanted to go.

Yet 216 people died that night.

They died because the natural way the pilots had of looking at things were not the way the designers and engineers thought they should be. Flying is like that. There are a lot of things that are non-intuitive. We train our way out of it to a degree. But a dark, stormy night in the middle of the Atlantic is not the place to discover a gap of that magnitude.

Throughout the book, we've been talking about making things people want. To do that, we had to learn how to take and use notes. We had to learn why paperwork is both necessary and completely inadequate by itself to handle that job. We talked about a lot of really easy ways that people introduce waste and friction into a development effort.

We learned how everybody can be a professional and do a great job and still get people killed. Or waste years of their life in unhappy product development death marches. It's not about being smart or knowing a huge amount of some engineering skill. It's not about being a craftsman, or being an expert in a certain area. These things may be important. You have to have them to build things right. But as far as building the right thing? It's never about that.

A bunch of school-age kids could have done the initial analysis work in creating the A330. And there's a good chance they would have done a better job than the professionals who actually did it. No amount of formal training can take the place of simple questioning and maintaining team alignment.

Once we got the dialectic, note-taking, modeling, and Structured Analysis in our heads, we moved on to tools. We learned how to capture important things. We learned how to pipe things around to where they are needed.

Walking through several examples using tools as we went, we started talking about the Meta bucket, or how we work together. We saw examples of using the work to build and validate Meta model, although we didn't take it that far. (I've saved most of the Meta conversation for the large team discussion coming in book 2. That's because when you're by yourself, as long as you're doing the work, nobody else cares what your process is. It's only as you start getting a lot of people involved that Meta becomes something more out in the open and important.)

We learned a lot about backlogs, what makes a good backlog, the many forms of bad backlogs, and how to keep your backlog simple and manageable. We did the same thing with refinement, learning a couple of dozen antipatterns and then talking about how an example refinement agenda would play out with real teams.

Then we started talking about processes in general. The TDA Wheel Of Pain shows us that there are only five categories of important questions, although the questions can occur at any time and in any order. But once we realize that there is a pattern and relationship between categories of important questions, we start realizing that we may not be asking some of the most important ones.

Information doesn't get to where it needs to go. People die.

We talked about oddball teams, teams that don't make things you can touch and interact with. We learned that Structured Analysis is useful no matter what you're doing, but if the target system is chaotic? You can't change it. If the target system is simple, it should have already been automated by whoever was doing the work. It's only target systems in the complicated and complex domains where creating and modifying target systems provide anything of value.

Finally, we took our free EasyAM tool and played around with it some. Since everything you're doing can be tagged, and since EasyAM can keep track of all the tags for you, you can use it to interact with and manage a lot of the project-tracking and corporate stuff that might be driving you nuts. You manage a build server, don't you? Isn't your analysis information more important than your code?

In a big way, what we've learned isn't that much more difficult than many of the other things we've had to learn to do our jobs. The hardest part about it is having to *unlearn* stuff we already thought we knew. When I say "Isn't your analysis information more important than your code?", most people would disagree. That's because most people, if they know anything about analysis at all, would think of it as some kind paper tiger exercise where it ends by giving a bunch of documents to the developers. In that world? No, the analysis isn't more important than the code.

But you know better now. You know what real analysis is, you know how it keeps happening whether or not we want it to, and you know that the alignment around questions, conversations, and tests is far more important than a bunch of bits somewhere. With enough of the right tests, I could build a hundred systems that would all make you happy. But with a system with no tests, I'm not even sure what it does right now, much less how to change it for the better.

Thank you for coming along. I hope to see you in future books!

*Ceterum autem censeo Carthaginem delendam esse*[^25-31]

[^25-31]: I figured I needed some kind of cool catch-phrase to end the book. Back in Roman days, there was a guy called Cato the Elder who really didn't like the city of Carthage. So no matter what else he was talking about, he always ended it with that phrase. It means something like "And finally, I conclude by saying Carthage must be destroyed!" Carthage *was* eventually destroyed, but I guess there's probably nothing wrong with destroying it again. Plus nobody has used the phrase in a long time -- and latin, right? How cool is that? Dang Carthogenians. Never met one I liked. (You know, you never hear about them doing much good in the world.)
