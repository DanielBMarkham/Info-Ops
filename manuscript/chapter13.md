# Chapter 13

Beethoven wasn't a pleasant person to be around. 

As a child, he was brought up from birth to be a great composer, and that's what he became. He didn't live in Vienna, which was the artistic center of the time. He lived out in the boonies -- but he studied and practiced like the dickens. When he was quite young, his family took him to Vienna for a performance competition.

All the other kids were much older -- teenagers. Many of them laughed at the country hick.

But not for long. Beethoven easily cleared out all the competition.

Leaving, one said to the other "I have seen the devil himself tonight play."

Once they realized they had a genius on their hands, they sent him to Haydn to be taught. Haydn was a prolific composer, the darling of the town. He wrote more than 100 symphonies. It was an honor to have him as a teacher.

Beethoven was not honored. We don't know for sure, but it's likely that Beethoven found him a nice but silly and pretentious old man peddling tricks from a long-lost age -- an age best forgotten.

Haydn was the master of what music was at the time: the history, the complexity, the nuance, the milieu of classical Vienna. Beethoven was the master of what music was going to be: a personal expression of art from the artist to the audience.[^13-2]

Haydn knew the rules and followed them; his audiences knew what to expect. Beethoven instinctively knew *how music worked in the mind* and broke whatever rules he felt like to get his feelings into the minds of the people listening. Haydn could put very complex and beautiful melodies together that would soar to the heavens. Beethoven could do that too -- when he wanted to.

Neither one was better or worse than the other, but they were definitely opposites. It had to have been a very interesting set of lessons!

Because Beethoven viewed music itself differently from those around him,

[^13-2]: Sometimes not even to the audience.

What if you could annotate your notes without using a complicated tool, then organize and share them automatically without having to send emails or hold meetings? The process of identifying important concepts and having conversations around them is the most important thing your team does. Even more importantly, any data you could collect, by definition, will fit somewhere in your analysis model.

Everything else we do in life we record and distribute.

If we have a system for tagging everything, why not automate it?

By breaking things down to the smallest pieces and using a tagging system, we can enter however much we want. Perhaps those notes are enough. Great! We're done.

Perhaps we'd like a domain model for our our nouns. If so, directly under our notes for today (or wherever else we'd like to put it), we add in the model details.

Note that we've separated the note-taking from the drawing. If you like drawing things out, you can do that. I like modeling as a group and that's the way I work. But you still write the notes down the same way.

Then if you want some output, like story cards, reports, or diagrams? That's just another output in the toolchain. Because everything is tagged, and because we know how to handle the tags, we can connect up various tools in a chain to collect and disseminate information.
