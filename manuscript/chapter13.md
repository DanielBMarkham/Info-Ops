# Chapter 13

## Beethoven's Fifth. The origami complexification factor.

From here on out, we're going to limit our conversation to technology development. Because our topic is knowledge and understanding, it applies anywhere, but this book is specifically dedicated to helping people develop technology, where a lack of analysis skills is quite painful.

I will try to keep the discussion non-technical, but there will be quite a bit of programming and math-related concepts coming your way. We'll also be doing mostly applied examples instead of concepts. A basic knowledge of programming and how technology works might be helpful. 

You have been warned.
